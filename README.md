# Notes
This contains various notes from self-studying.
It is written for me, as a way to solidify my knowledge while studying, because I find that I learn better when I have to create coherent explanations of concepts. This said, the goal is not to communicate knowledge, but to gain knowledge.
Hopefully it will be useful as a place of reference for myself in the future.
All explanations are created with (future) me in mind, so many things might be left implicit, and will probably not be useable for anyone beside me.
